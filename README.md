# Tax Calculation Application
Author: Leticia Nhundu

## Description
This application is built using .NET 8  and provides functionality for tax calculations. It retrieves tax calculations, performs tax calculations based on different tax methods, and updates the tax calculation results.

## Requirements
* NET 8
* Visual Studio 2022

## Improvements
If more time was available, the following improvements could be made:

* Implement dependency injection for better code organization and testability.
* Create separate classes for retrieving tax calculations, calculating taxes, and updating tax calculations to improve code modularity and maintainability.
* Enhance error handling by implementing robust exception handling, such as logging exceptions or providing detailed error information.
* reusing the same connection
* Making use of cache
